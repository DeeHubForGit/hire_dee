            <h3>What It Does</h3>
            <p>Accepts a company domain and builds a structured security testing scope across:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Websites and subdomains</li>
                <li>APIs and documentation endpoints</li>
                <li>Mobile applications (iOS and Android)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Produces consistent, explainable outputs suitable for security programs and auditors.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Key Design Strengths</h3>
            
            <div class="strength-card">
                <h4>Subdomain Intelligence, Not Just Discovery</h4>
                <p>Uses Subfinder for discovery, then filters, normalises, groups and enriches results so they are meaningful for downstream decisions rather than raw lists.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strength-card">
                <h4>AI Guided by Structure and Constraints</h4>
                <p>AI is used after data has been cleaned, deduplicated and framed. This dramatically improves recommendation quality and avoids "AI guesswork."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strength-card">
                <h4>Mobile App Discovery with Controlled Ambiguity</h4>
                <p>App store searches are inherently noisy. To manage this, the API supports multiple explicit search modes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>APP NAME</strong> - Search by application name only</li>
                    <li><strong>DEVELOPER</strong> - Search by developer/publisher</li>
                    <li><strong>EITHER</strong> - Broader discovery (match either criteria)</li>
                    <li><strong>BOTH</strong> - Precision matching (match both criteria)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This makes the trade-offs visible instead of hiding them behind a single opaque search.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strength-card">
                <h4>Shared Architecture Across Platforms</h4>
                <p>Initial AI-generated implementations for iOS and Android diverged. The solution was refactored to use a shared delegate pattern:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced duplication and cut the codebase from ~300 lines to ~150</li>
                    <li>Improved maintainability</li>
                    <li>Prevented platform-specific design drift</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strength-card">
                <h4>Heuristics Before AI for API Discovery</h4>
                <p>Likely API and documentation endpoints are identified, grouped and scored first. AI is then used to refine naming and recommendations, not to blindly search the web.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strength-card">
                <h4>Config-Driven and Extensible</h4>
                <p>Behaviour is controlled via configuration rather than hard-coded rules, making the system easy to evolve, test and extend without breaking existing logic.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Architectural Control with AI</h4>
                <p>This project demonstrates strong architectural control when working with AI: knowing when to lean on automation, when to constrain it and when to override it with deliberate design decisions.</p>
                <p>The result is a system that is reliable, explainable and practical in real-world security programs.</p>
                <p>Rather than treating AI as a magic solution, this API shows how to combine deterministic logic, structured data and constrained AI reasoning to produce consistent, defensible outputs that security teams can trust.</p>
